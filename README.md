This project aims to evaluate and compare the performances of the Multi-task model with its Single-task counterparts. 
The conditions for each model were similar and all important factors were considered. 
All models used the same MNIST dataset and the same  parameters.  The  structural  difference 
between  Multi-task  and  Single-task  models  is minimal. The difference is only the fact that the 
Multi-task  model  combines  two  tasks,  but  the number  of  layers  dedicated  to  each  task  is 
identical.  Every  decision  and  parameter  is described in detail and has a proper explanation. 
Every  important  result  is  documented.
